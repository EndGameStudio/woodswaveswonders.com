<ul>
<li><strong>Storefront</strong>: In progress; we're trying to maintain a sustainable pace, which sometimes feels sooooo slow. It feels great to mark off todos, though. As we look back, we've marked off A LOT of todos! We'll get there!</li>
<li><strong>Products</strong>: Just about ready; final touches, really. Can't wait to start sharing final results.</li>

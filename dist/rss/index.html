Ten months ago, the concept of opening an Etsy shop was litterally to make some stickers, pin banners, and &quot;whosits and whatsits galore. You want thing-a-ma-bobs?

My Etsy shop concept rapidly evolved into A BUSINESS EMPIRE MUAHAHAHAHAH...Seriously, I wanted to start things off &quot;right&quot;. I wanted a website (this little gem right here is the result of that.) I wanted a business social media presence. Then, I figured I&apos;d video this whole hot mess, learn how to edit video, find time to create a You Tube channel, and just add that to my ever-growing list of to dos...see where this is going?
